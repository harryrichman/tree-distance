# Minors of tree distance matrices

### Abstract
We prove that the principal minors of the distance matrix of a tree satisfy a combinatorial expression involving counts of rooted spanning forests of the underlying tree. This generalizes a result of Graham and Pollak. We also give such an expression for the case of edge-weighted trees.
